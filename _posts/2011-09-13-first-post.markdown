As you can see, things are a bit bare-bones around here.
I just switched over to Jekyll (like a good hipster-hacker), and am
in the process of designing myself a new site.

In the meantime, here's my old [Posterous blog](http://codebread.posterous.com).
I also do a lot of blogging [here](https://blog.honestappalachia.org).

This will be the best blog ever.
